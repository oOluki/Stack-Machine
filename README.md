# Stack-Machine
My first ever virtual machine, Stack Machine (SM) is designed to be a simple virtual machine compatiple with multiple platforms.
This virtual machine strides to be very stack based, where most operation take their arguments from the stack (there are no registers).

This virtual machine was highly motivated/influenced by https://github.com/tsoding/bm early architecture.
